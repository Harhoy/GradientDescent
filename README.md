# GradientDescent

Project to learn how about gradient descent.

Two different methods are implemented:

(1) Simple, unconstrained gradient descent
(2) Constrained gradient descent for equality constraints using penalty method


Input start vector and function to be optimized into "optimizer" function

Function to be optimized must take a vector "x" of parameters to be optimized

Does not support step size computation.
